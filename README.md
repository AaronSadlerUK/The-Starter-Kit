# 9.0-Starter-Kit

This Github project is used to manage the final build of the Starter Kit and is _not_ meant to be used as the Starter Kit content source.

_TODO_: We need to merge this repo: https://github.com/umbraco/Starterkit-TheUmbracoCommunity into this one and remove the CSS/JS one; they should exist in this one only.

You can find the Starter Kit as the default option in Umbraco 7.6.4+, as well as in the package repository on Our Umbraco.

Get in touch if you wish to have access to this Umbraco Cloud project, which contains the master content for the Starter Kit:
https://umbraco-starter-kit.s1.umbraco.io

Alternatively, if you are doing development for the Starter Kit, you can launch the website project contained in this repo.
